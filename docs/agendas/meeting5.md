# Approval of the agenda
*Make sure everything that needs to be discussed is in the agenda or add it if something is missing.*

# Points of action
*The items below are things you should look into after the first meeting. During the meeting you can divide (some of) the work between the team members, so that everybody has something to do afterwards.*

 - Set a goal for this week, based on the expectation of the TA
 - Talk about the fact that our main focus should shift on connecting the pieces that we've built so far
 - Decide what everyone is going to work on this week

# Action points for next week (Scrum board)
*Every week you fill the Scrum board with new action points for that week. See the to-do list for the items you should implement.*

# Any other business
*If anybody has something that should be discussed but came up with that after the agenda was finalized (in point 2), he/she should bring that up now so that it can be discussed after all.*

# Questions for the TA

 - We were wondering if you could explain us a bit how can we manage to do an HTTP requests from front end
 - Feedback on our progress on the quiz

# Question round
*If there are any questions, now is the time to ask them.*

# Closing
*Now you can start working on the project. Good luck!*
